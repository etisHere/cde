# My Code 'safe'

## Note
All that is put in here are random things I have worked on in the pass I felt the need to save. 
Some of these are 10+ years old and I made when I was young.

- **Expect the worst** And only the worst
- **Enjoy the randomness** Random=Good
- **Some of this will be like someone took a copy and stuffed it down your throat** You'd be right to feel that way

### Enjoy
I can't say I'll be updating this much or even at all but all of it will be forever in my heart.
Gotta start somewhere!
