This is just a simple app i made that will show some space info.

All it really was/is, is for myself to learn to work with api's.


"WHY DOES THIS ASK FOR MY CORDS?!"
because when you go to the iss stats it will tell you how many times it has passed over you/more cool info.(1 and 1 work just fine)
